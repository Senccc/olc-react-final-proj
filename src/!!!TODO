/* TODO 
Set up the on hover buttons + actually make them buttons with functions
Make a form for the create new notes thingy
Some of the elements do something on hover and some don't, gonna hafta fix that sometime soon
Think of UI element to put to indicate that you can change the folder name bcuz the figma design don hav it for some reason
Still haven't done any tests, get around to doing it sometime

Implement the api mumbo jumbos (should be like:
  - Make the form in FirstPage cause the directory post method to be ran
  - Make the new notes form do the note post method thing and fill the title in the api using the string from the form
  - Idk what I should do with the description form now that I found out that the API only store 2 things that aren't just ID stuff 
    (Maybe I can do something with the body part in the API to like have the description and contents forms merge to like 
    one string with like a format or something to be able to tell where the split between desc and conts happen??? maybe???)
  - Make the Title form be filled with the title data from the API (can you even do that? I hope so)
  - Same thing as the title one but with the contents and description form
  - Have it so that pressing the save button triggers the put method
  - After I make the UI and buttons for folder renaming, gonna hafta implement the put method from the API so that it actually does something
  - Should probably just have it trigger a function call or something instead though (<<=== I didn't make that one, Intellisense did. 
    I just put it there cus I didn't even know that it can do that and I think that's just hilarious that it tought of that)
  - Delete... for everything... though tbh that seems to be the most simple one it just sucks that I can't really do that first since I need to actually
    have *something to delete* in order to delete something (at least as far as I know of anyway)
(Oh god I need to have all of these also do the get method... Yeah I ain't finishing this (at least not in time for the submission, 
will definitely revisit tho, dis sum gud exp))
(All of these also has to use and show their corresponding data as well so I'm mega screwed, but that's future me's problem)
)
